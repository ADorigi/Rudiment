# Here it goes

I plan for this post to be the start. The start of something mundane but still unique. The start of sharing. The start of distributing. The start of an attempt to unify knowledge around the world. The start of this blog. The start of rudiment. 

That was kinda dramatic. But why not. Things dont need to be big. You need to pretend they are. People might actually join you in believing. And so I start this blog with the thought of sharing useful things. Sometimes even useless stuff. I will try to label them accordingly. So that you dont waste time going through useless stuff.(I hope you go still go through them). Posts here will be accurate to my knowledge. But nothing you read here should be considered final and binding. You are free to ignore them.
